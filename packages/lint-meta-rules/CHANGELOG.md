# @noctcore/lint-meta-rules

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`9b9d078`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/9b9d078290f0ff4a8d8b0ca221bd867f186ca2c6) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - New: `createTranslationDeadKeysRule`, a whole-program dead translation-key check, on a new entry
  point `@noctcore/lint-meta-rules/i18n`.

  Dead-key detection cannot be sound as an ESLint rule: a per-file rule never sees every call site, and
  keys flow as data. This lint-meta factory walks every configured source file once, resolves call
  sites with the same visitor and catalog loader as `noctcore-contracts/translation-key-exists`, and
  also counts every string literal, template literal and `+` chain in the source as a possible key. It
  reports only keys that no call names and no string spells, and it reports no dead key at all when a
  source file cannot be analysed. Configure it with catalog locations and source globs; there are no
  built-in paths. Blind spots are listed in `docs/rules/translation-dead-keys.md`.

  The main entry point is unchanged and still never loads ESLint. The `i18n` entry needs the optional
  peers `eslint` (>= 9) and `@typescript-eslint/parser`.

  `@noctcore/eslint-plugin-contracts` now exports the i18n building blocks behind
  `translation-key-exists` (`createTranslationVisitor`, `catalogsForNamespace`, `catalogHasKey`,
  `catalogHasPrefix`, `translationSettingsOf`, `TRANSLATION_DEFAULTS` and their types), so the two
  checks share one implementation. Export-only: no rule behaviour changes.

### Patch Changes

- [`d1a1d2c`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/d1a1d2c1a48b62c38138e5b7fa502e64b3533242) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Test-only: the five CI-hygiene rules (`github-actions-sha-pinned`, `github-actions-runner-pinned`,
  `service-image-digest-pin`, `dockerfile-base-image-digest-pin`, `security-scanner-version-parity`)
  now also run against a real temp directory containing `.github/workflows/` and `.devcontainer/`,
  through the real `harness lint-meta` CLI under Bun. The fake-context tests could not catch the Bun
  dot-directory glob bug fixed in `@noctcore/harness` 0.3.0; these do. All five fail on harness 0.2.0
  (including the false "no workflow pins" report that hid a real 8.19.0 vs 8.18.0 drift) and pass on
  0.3.0. No runtime change.
- Updated dependencies [[`9b9d078`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/9b9d078290f0ff4a8d8b0ca221bd867f186ca2c6)]:
  - @noctcore/eslint-plugin-contracts@0.5.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`ce31932`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/ce319327645396110d272864c7e09472cbfc06da) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Add five CI-hygiene rule factories (category `ci`): `createGithubActionsShaPinnedRule`, `createGithubActionsRunnerPinnedRule`, `createServiceImageDigestPinRule`, `createDockerfileBaseImageDigestPinRule` and `createSecurityScannerVersionParityRule`. Each project-specific constant (workflow and Dockerfile/compose globs, skip dirs, the floating-label pattern, the unpinned-image exemption list, and the scanner name, variables and hook path) is a factory option with a default.

### Patch Changes

- [`d8c271a`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/d8c271aa57b13361793356329f3361aaa2ef8b06) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Bump the `@noctcore/harness` dependency range to `^0.2.0`. No consumed API changed (types and runtime exports used by this package — `IMetaRule`, `IViolation`, `IMetaCtx`, `DEFAULT_BASELINE_DIR`, `isGrandfathered`, `loadBaseline` — are unchanged between harness 0.1.0 and 0.2.0); this only widens the resolvable dependency range.

- [`7feaab7`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/7feaab74f3fb393d6d1976640fa79478f7975fea) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Require `@noctcore/harness` `^0.3.0`.

  This is a correctness bump, not housekeeping. Harness 0.3.0 fixes `ctx.glob`, which
  under Bun returned an empty list for any dot-directory segment, including a fully
  literal `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Four of this package's CI-hygiene rules glob
  exactly that path by default, so on harness 0.2.0 under Bun they reported nothing at
  all, and `security-scanner-version-parity` reported a false violation while hiding a
  real scanner drift.

  A caret range on a `0.x` version never crosses the minor, so `^0.2.0` could not pick
  the fix up on its own.
