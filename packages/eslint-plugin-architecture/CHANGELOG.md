## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/44) [`da6ce97`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/da6ce97dbfa4eb3a3bb39444929276661d8857b7) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. The README now follows the same layout in every
  package: requirements, install, a quick start with `files` and the TypeScript parser, one config
  block for every opt-in rule, the rules table and the severity policy. Every rule doc now has the same
  sections in the same order: why, what it flags, what it does not flag, options, when not to use it.

- [#40](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/40) [`132a0a0`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/132a0a0dd147abe504a946b1cfd0621b6a103885) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. Each package's npm page now links to its page on the
  docs site (`homepage` and a **Docs** link at the top of the README), and every plugin README states
  its requirements: ESLint 9 or newer, flat config only, and a `recommended` preset that sets no `files`
  and no parser, with a snippet for linting TypeScript. `@noctcore/eslint-utils` ships a README. Rule
  docs describe what a rule does today; third-party credits moved to a short section at the end.

- [#41](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/41) [`b25246e`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/b25246e914911df10ab1119252cf665eaa71fb70) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. The rules table in each README is now generated from
  the rules' own metadata, with the same columns in every package: in `recommended`, needs options,
  fixable, suggestions, needs type information. Rule links point at the docs site. Every rule doc
  now opens with a one-line status header saying the same. Rules that do nothing until configured
  carry a new `meta.docs.requiresOptions: true`, and `@noctcore/eslint-utils` types that field
  (`NoctcoreRuleDocs`). A project that spreads `recommended` sees no new errors.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [`734f0f6`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/734f0f610b8b17dd112f514965b3b2d6bbbdf452) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Report the real package version in `meta.version`.

  Every plugin published a `meta.version` taken from a literal in its source while the
  version itself came from changesets, so the two drifted: all nine were behind, contracts
  by three minors (it said `0.3.0` while publishing `0.6.0`) and prisma by two (`0.1.0`
  against `0.3.1`). ESLint reads that field to identify a plugin, so anything keyed on
  plugin identity saw a build that had not existed for months.

  The constant is now written from package.json during `version-packages`, and a test
  compares the two so they cannot drift apart again.

- Updated dependencies [[`3166c84`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/3166c8468dcfa29e6c964aa3d0035461b2420e6a)]:
  - @noctcore/eslint-utils@0.1.1

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`bd6d25e`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/bd6d25e7a0a0d46bd62b331d52acaf890171c429) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Every rule doc's examples now run as tests. Each fence is labelled `bad` (the rule must report it), `good` (the rule must not), or `prose` (not run, with the reason stated), and a good example that only passes by moving file or changing options says so.

  Running them corrected three docs. `no-sensitive-fields-in-logs` offered `{ password: redact(password) }` as the fix, which the rule reports twice. `prefer-parallel-awaits` showed module-scope awaits, which the rule never checks. `single-semantic-module` fenced a JSX example as `ts`, where it does not parse. `no-process-exit` gained the example it never had.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`97b2648`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/97b264831de668a78128dc05034c288e955d99b8) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Add `single-semantic-module`, ported from `@boring-stack-pkg/eslint-plugin-module-boundaries` 0.2.0 (MIT) so it runs on ESLint 10. A module's exported declarations are classified by AST shape into `type`, `constant`, `function`, `class`, `react-component`, `hook`, `schema` or `enum`, and a mix is reported unless an `allow` group covers it. `ignorePrivateDeclarations` defaults to `true`, so a private render helper or filter constant is not a second concern, and a declaration exported later by name (`export { x }`, `export default X`) counts as exported. Ships `off` in `recommended`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add 4 rules: `barrel-purity`, `filename-matches-export` (suggestion fix), `colocated-test-required` (opt-in), and `max-import-depth` (conditional fix).
