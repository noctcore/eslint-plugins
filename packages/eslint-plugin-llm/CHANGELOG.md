## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#155](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/155) [`4e1129f`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/4e1129f70f9449f4feee9dca6228f2d6432393c5) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Cap the peer ranges at what CI tests: `eslint >=9.0.0 <11` and `typescript >=5.0.0 <7` (lint-meta-rules declares only the eslint peer). typescript-eslint 8 refuses TypeScript 7, and no CI leg runs ESLint 11 yet; a range widens once a leg proves the next major.

- [#80](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/80) [`6ef2434`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/6ef2434bae1749d4d0ef5c8368cd8e762ba2a91c) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Give CommonJS consumers their own type declarations. Each `exports` entry now has one `types` per condition: `import` resolves `index.d.ts` and `require` resolves `index.d.cts`, the file tsup already emitted. Before, a CommonJS TypeScript project got the ESM declarations for the `.cjs` build.

- [#106](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/106) [`1f57e60`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/1f57e6027007cd4956cc9a382c915c1371f2209e) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - The `recommended` config object now has a `name` (`noctcore-<plugin>/recommended`), so the ESLint config inspector and config error messages show which block it is instead of an anonymous one. Nothing else about the preset changes.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#46](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/46) [`59c6c1f`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/59c6c1f900670e9c015429cb6b54787fc6a06719) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. The README rules table now marks every rule as either ✅ on in `recommended` or 🔘 opt-in (off or left out of the preset), in a Preset column, so a rule you have to enable yourself no longer shows up as a blank row. Opt-in rule docs say the same in their status line. Package descriptions on npm now list what each plugin actually covers, and the monorepo quick start says plainly that `recommended` enables nothing until you give the rules your workspace scope.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/44) [`da6ce97`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/da6ce97dbfa4eb3a3bb39444929276661d8857b7) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. The README now follows the same layout in every
  package: requirements, install, a quick start with `files` and the TypeScript parser, one config
  block for every opt-in rule, the rules table and the severity policy. Every rule doc now has the same
  sections in the same order: why, what it flags, what it does not flag, options, when not to use it.

- [#40](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/40) [`132a0a0`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/132a0a0dd147abe504a946b1cfd0621b6a103885) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. Each package's npm page now links to its page on the
  docs site (`homepage` and a **Docs** link at the top of the README), and every plugin README states
  its requirements: ESLint 9 or newer, flat config only, and a `recommended` preset that sets no `files`
  and no parser, with a snippet for linting TypeScript. `@noctcore/eslint-utils` ships a README. Rule
  docs describe what a rule does today; third-party credits moved to a short section at the end.

- [#41](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/41) [`b25246e`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/b25246e914911df10ab1119252cf665eaa71fb70) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. The rules table in each README is now generated from
  the rules' own metadata, with the same columns in every package: in `recommended`, needs options,
  fixable, suggestions, needs type information. Rule links point at the docs site. Every rule doc
  now opens with a one-line status header saying the same. Rules that do nothing until configured
  carry a new `meta.docs.requiresOptions: true`, and `@noctcore/eslint-utils` types that field
  (`NoctcoreRuleDocs`). A project that spreads `recommended` sees no new errors.

### Minor Changes

- [#19](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/19) [`0c26d50`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/0c26d50f109843c9232c79d7349d023b775922c6) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - New package: rules for code that calls LLM SDKs. First rule, `no-llm-output-to-sink`, in `recommended` at `error`.

  It reports text returned by an awaited OpenAI (`chat.completions.create`, `responses.create`), Anthropic (`messages.create`, including a `tool_use` block's `input`) or Vercel AI SDK (`generateText`, `generateObject` from `ai`) call when it reaches `eval`, `new Function`, a `child_process` shell, Prisma's `$queryRawUnsafe` / `$executeRawUnsafe`, `innerHTML` / `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `document.write`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, the origin of a `fetch` URL or an `fs` path in the same function (OWASP LLM05, Improper Output Handling). It follows `const` bindings and destructuring only, and stays silent once the value goes through a sanitizer, a schema `.parse`, a helper call, a parameter or a `let`, so it needs no configuration. This is a new package, so no existing build changes until you install it and spread `recommended`.
