# @noctcore/eslint-plugin-rsc

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#46](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/46) [`59c6c1f`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/59c6c1f900670e9c015429cb6b54787fc6a06719) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. The README rules table now marks every rule as either ✅ on in `recommended` or 🔘 opt-in (off or left out of the preset), in a Preset column, so a rule you have to enable yourself no longer shows up as a blank row. Opt-in rule docs say the same in their status line. Package descriptions on npm now list what each plugin actually covers, and the monorepo quick start says plainly that `recommended` enables nothing until you give the rules your workspace scope.

### Patch Changes

- [#44](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/44) [`da6ce97`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/da6ce97dbfa4eb3a3bb39444929276661d8857b7) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. The README now follows the same layout in every
  package: requirements, install, a quick start with `files` and the TypeScript parser, one config
  block for every opt-in rule, the rules table and the severity policy. Every rule doc now has the same
  sections in the same order: why, what it flags, what it does not flag, options, when not to use it.

- [#40](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/40) [`132a0a0`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/132a0a0dd147abe504a946b1cfd0621b6a103885) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. Each package's npm page now links to its page on the
  docs site (`homepage` and a **Docs** link at the top of the README), and every plugin README states
  its requirements: ESLint 9 or newer, flat config only, and a `recommended` preset that sets no `files`
  and no parser, with a snippet for linting TypeScript. `@noctcore/eslint-utils` ships a README. Rule
  docs describe what a rule does today; third-party credits moved to a short section at the end.

- [#41](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/41) [`b25246e`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/b25246e914911df10ab1119252cf665eaa71fb70) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - Documentation only, no rule behaviour change. The rules table in each README is now generated from
  the rules' own metadata, with the same columns in every package: in `recommended`, needs options,
  fixable, suggestions, needs type information. Rule links point at the docs site. Every rule doc
  now opens with a one-line status header saying the same. Rules that do nothing until configured
  carry a new `meta.docs.requiresOptions: true`, and `@noctcore/eslint-utils` types that field
  (`NoctcoreRuleDocs`). A project that spreads `recommended` sees no new errors.

### Minor Changes

- [#15](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/pull/15) [`e540bfd`](https://github.com/noctcore/eslint-plugins/commit/e540bfd49146b5f00b8deb0954f0fa83f43566a9) Thanks [@Shironex](https://github.com/Shironex)! - New package: React Server Components and App Router correctness rules, framework-neutral where the RSC model allows. One rule, in `recommended` at `error`: `no-navigation-throw-in-try`.

  `no-navigation-throw-in-try` reports a call to `redirect`, `permanentRedirect`, `notFound`, `forbidden` or `unauthorized` imported from `next/navigation` (aliases and `import * as nav` included) inside a `try` whose `catch` swallows the error those functions throw, so the navigation never happens. A `catch` that calls `unstable_rethrow(error)` from `next/navigation` or rethrows the caught error (`throw error`, also behind a guard such as `if (isRedirectError(error))`) is accepted. Calls outside a `try`, in a `try`/`finally` with no `catch`, in the `catch` or `finally` itself, inside a function merely defined in the `try`, and same-named functions not imported from `next/navigation` are left alone. A project that spreads `recommended` can see new errors, each one a navigation that is currently being swallowed.
