New package: Prisma tenancy and transaction guardrails, moved from a consumer's workspace-local plugin so projects inherit them by installing a package instead of copying rules. Four rules, all in `recommended`: `no-unscoped-prisma-outside-allowlist`, `no-raw-sql-outside-allowlist`, `prisma-write-in-transaction` and `prisma-tx-uses-tx-not-client`.

No project convention is hardcoded. The Prisma receiver name (`receiverPattern`, default `prisma`), the unscoped client's property (`unscopedProperty`, default `unscoped`), escape-hatch functions (`escapeHatchFns`, default none), extra client properties such as a repository's `this.client` (`clientProperties`, default none) and transaction-client names (`txRootNames`, default `tx`) are all documented options. Allowlist globs match both the absolute path and the workspace-root-relative path, with no glob dependency.

Also exports the shared building blocks: the Prisma method sets, a small schema reader and `reconcileTenantRegistry`.
